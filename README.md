aws-scripts
===========

Just some scripts I run on some of my AWS EC2 instances.

I use these scripts to monitor who and what might be trying to access my EC2 instances.
And why!  These scripts offer, at this time, relatively "interesting" information.

That said, Amazon EC2 instances are NAT'd such that their public IP is different than their
actual IP.  So they are somewhat protected.   At some point, my intent is to remove this protection and 
drop the layer of protection to the EC2 instance itself.

We'll see what comes of that, if anything.

If you are interested in constributing, and/or participating, send me an email.
